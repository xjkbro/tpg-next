            "We started TPG as a joke. We initially came up with TPG which stood for Tiny Penis Gang. It was interesting to see that everyone that happened to be on the enemy team would always have something to say about our clan tag when we all played together. There was a lot of 'What does TPG stand for?' or 'Can I join TPG?', most of the time it's usually a joke but then I thought about it. With my programming background, I could make a legit offical website for us and by playing with the clan name, we can get some recognition and make this organization a thing, recruit creators to play for our organization and have fun doing it.
